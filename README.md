# IndividualGame
A 2D platformer project that focuses on learning different mechanics, how to use them to create levels around those mechanics, and post-processing.


# What I Learned
As this was my first experience making a game, I wanted to use my previous coding experience to create a somewhat polished experience that I could build off from in future endeavors.

* Unity post-processing and particle systems
* An understanding of physics-based movement
* Implementations of different 2D game mechanics such as dashing, rewinding time, item-collection, and more
